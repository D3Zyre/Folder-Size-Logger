# Folder-Size-Logger
logs the size of the folders on your computer. you can also graph the result over time.

run Folder_Size_Logger_Runner.py for automatically running Folder_Size_Logger_V4.py every set amount of time

libraries needed are os, time, and datetime (which I think all come with python by default) and for graphing: matplotlib, numpy, csv as well (csv comes default I think)

This should work with all versions of python3 but if you have any issues then try python3 version 3.10
